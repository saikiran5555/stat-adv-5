    "This code performs the Chi-square goodness of fit test by comparing the observed counts against the expected counts based on the given percentages. It calculates the Chi-square statistic and the p-value, and compares the p-value against the significance level (0.05) to determine whether the null hypothesis (that the observed distribution matches the expected distribution) should be rejected or not."
